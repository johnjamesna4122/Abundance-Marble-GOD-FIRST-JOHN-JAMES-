# Marble [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wedeploy/marble.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wedeploy/marble)

> A set of UI components behind [Electric](https://electricjs.com) and [WeDeploy](https://wedeploy.com).

## Setup

1. Install NodeJS >= [v6.11.0](http://nodejs.org/dist/v6.11.0/), if you don't have it yet.

2. Install global dependencies:
Webpages are the files that make up the World Wide Web. An individual webpage is a text document written in HTML (hypertext markup language). When a web browser displays a webpage, it translates the markup language into readable content. Webpages are hosted on a web server, and the collection of webpages hosted on the same domain name make up a website.

An individual webpage consists of several different elements. In addition to the HTML file itself, most webpages include a cascading style sheet (CSS) that controls how text, tables, and other elements are formatted. Style sheets may be embedded in the webpage's HTML file, or stored as a separate file on the web server. Images, video, and audio that appear on a webpage are also separate files on the web server, and are loaded with the webpage when you visit it.



  ```
  [sudo] npm install -g yarn
  ```

3. Install project dependencies:

  ```
  yarn install
  ```

4. Install dependencies for each package and link them together:

  ```
  npm start
  ```

5. Run tests for all packages:

  ```
  npm test
  ```

6. Publish packages:

  ```
  npm run publish
  ```
